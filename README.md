## Algorithmic Trading — Trend Strategy with Data-Driven Insights  

This project goes beyond visualization — it’s a full trading analytics pipeline built to **detect trends, test strategies, and quantify performance** using Apple’s historical stock data (2014–2020). It combines **technical indicators**, **signal generation**, and **backtesting** to explore how momentum-based rules can outperform or complement traditional *buy-and-hold* investing.  


## What I Built  

    - Data Pipeline: Imported and cleaned Apple stock data using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
    - Visualization: Plotted trend movements and moving-average crossovers with `matplotlib`.  
    - Trading Logic: Designed buy/sell signal functions using **30-day and 100-day SMA** windows.  
    - Backtesting Engine: Computed portfolio equity, trade performance, and risk metrics like **CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown**.  
    - Advanced Variant: Added **EMA**, **RSI filter**, and **volatility-adjusted position sizing** for more realistic modeling and regime control.  
    - Benchmarking: Compared strategy results against a Buy-and-Hold baseline with visual equity curves.  


## Key Outcomes  

    - Built a modular trading framework — easy to extend for multiple tickers and timeframes.  
    - Visualized buy/sell signals that align with trend reversals.  
    - Quantified risk-adjusted performance, showing how simple moving-average logic can compete with passive investing when enhanced with smart filters.  
    - Created a foundation for future algorithmic trading experiments (Bayesian tuning, API integration, Streamlit dashboard).  


## Tech Stack  

`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`  
Custom indicators for **SMA, EMA, RSI**, and performance metrics.
